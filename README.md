# Your portfolio

(This document is the plan of the project and will be updated regularly. I made sure not to use too many technical words for people who will start with Git & Github)

## What's the plan?
We are going to build a simple portfolio for a freelance web designer.
We need to have:
- Homepage
- References
- About
- Contact

## Come on, it's too simple!
Yes indeed, but the idea is learn to work together and use Git & Github. Don't worry, there will be more complex projects later on! :)

## What languages will we use?
We'll start with pure HTML, pure CSS and pure Javascript. No frameworks. The website must be compatible with most modern browsers (and Internet Explorer from version 9) and responsive (adaptable to mobile devices). If you learn HTML, CSS or Javascript, you might find it a bit difficult but I really suggest you to participate and ask any questions you have (there is no stupid question) because working on a project, making tons of mistakes and collaborating with people is the best way to learn!

## Let's leave the Master in peace for the time being...
I would suggest that we leave the master for the moment and that we create our own branch, and we'll merge later on.
I'm sure that some of you, who don't know Git or Github yet, are saying: "What the f*** are you talking about?" 
Don't worry, we'll explain, we won't leave you behind! ;)

## That's for you!
After this project is finished and we make a beautiful portfolio, feel free to use the code for yourself, add your own text and your own pictures, if you don't have a portfolio yet!
