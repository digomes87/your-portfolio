## What's the plan?
We are going to build a simple portfolio for a web designer.
You need:
- Homepage
- References
- About
- Contact

## Come on, it's too simple!
Yes indeed, but the idea is learn to work together and use Git & Github. Don't worry, there will be more complex projects later on! :)

## Let us leave the Master in peace for the moment!
I would suggest that we leave the master for the moment and that we create our own branch, and we'll merge later on.
I'm sure that some of you, who don't know Github yet, are saying: "What the f*** are you talking about?" 
Don't worry, we'll explain, we won't leave you behind! ;)

## That's your present!
After this project is finished and we make a beautiful portfolio, feel free to use the code for yourself, add your own text and your own pictures, if you don't have a portfolio yet!
