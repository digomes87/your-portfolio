# Project proposal

The purpose of this project is to have the Web Designers & Developers Ireland group practice their skills, share and learn about web development and design.

At the beginning we are proposing that the website should be initiated with the simplest technologies , leaving room for more advanced implementation later on

HTML CSS and JavaScript should be the focus at the beginning and have the website use a simple framework like Bootstrap, Boilerplate or Foundation.

Github should be used to develop and contribute to this project and all tasks will be listed in the issue tracker

Members can pick a task or will get assigned and can work on that task on their own time with no time limit.

When the project reaches the proposed milestone and we have most tasks done we push for the live version and fix any immediate bugs.

After the push to master we will re-evaluate the project and create a new set of tasks.

Members should choose their team according to their knowledge and interests, Developers will mostly work with coding and back-end development and designers will do the front-end work.


This is the proposed website structure:

Home - (home page)  
Articles - (parent of all web development pages)  
Contact (contact page)
